## File Structure

```
smart-pot-website/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── style.css           # Custom CSS styles

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. The website uses external libraries (Animate.css and AOS) loaded via CDN, so an internet connection is required for full functionality.

## Adding the Dashboard Image

- Place your dashboard mockup image in `assets/images/dashboard-mockup.png`.
- The image should be a screenshot or mockup of the IoT dashboard interface.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Animate.css (for animations)
- AOS (Animate On Scroll)

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate with actual IoT backend for real-time data
- Add more interactive features like simulated sensor readings
- Implement a backend for the contact form
